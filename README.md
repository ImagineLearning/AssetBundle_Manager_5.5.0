### H3 This is a slightly modified version for Unity 5.5.0.  Unity's AssetBundle Manager didn't work out of the box for me and required some changes.  This project reflects those changes.

Some include:
- Making the manager NON SERVER related.  The server doesn't even work, no clue how to fix
- Fixed how it saw local file paths or the lack there of.
- Changed where AssetBundles are stored, which is in the assets/StreamedAssets folder.  This is the best place to hold them.
- Other minor work.
- ???
- Profit!!
